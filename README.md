# First Flight #29: TwentyOne
I’m proud to share that I secured 2nd place with a total of 293 XP!

This milestone is especially meaningful because it’s my second competitive audit, and I can already see the growth and learning from the experience. Diving deep into contract security and uncovering vulnerabilities is both challenging and rewarding.

A huge thank you to the organizers and participants for making this such an exciting and collaborative event.

Onward and upward as I continue honing my skills and contributing to the security of blockchain ecosystems!

## About the Project

The "TwentyOne" protocol is a smart contract implementation of the classic blackjack card game, where users can wager 1 ETH to participate with a chance to double their money!

## Actors

- Player: The user who interacts with the contract to start and play a game. A player must deposit 1 ETH to play, with a maximum payout of 2 ETH upon winning.
- Dealer: The virtual counterpart managed by the smart contract. The dealer draws cards based on game logic.
